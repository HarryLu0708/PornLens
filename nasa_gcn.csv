The Swift/UVOT began settled observations of the field of GRB 231205B
216 s after the BAT trigger (Evans et al., GCN Circ. 35269).
No optical afterglow consistent with the XRT position
(Osborne et al. 35275) is detected in the initial UVOT exposures.

The Glowbug gamma-ray telescope [1,2], operating on the International Space Station, reports the detection of GRB 231208A, which was also detected by Astrosat/CZTI (GCN 35306).

Using an adaptive window with a resolution of 32-ms, the burst onset is determined to be 2023-12-08 02:29:43.384 with a duration of 5.1 s and a total significance of about 38 sigma.  The light curve comprises two primary peaks at ~T0+2s and ~T0+3s.

Using a standard power-law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff [3] to model the emission over this duration results in a photon index dN/dE~E^x of x=2.5 and a cutoff energy (""Epeak"") of 136 keV.  The modeled 10-10000 keV fluence is 9.1e-07 erg/cm^2.

The best-fit localization is RA, Decl. (J2000, deg) = 339.7, 21.2 with a radius of 14.8 deg (95% confidence) with a highly uncertain systematic uncertainty.

The analysis results presented here are preliminary and use a response function that lacks a detailed characterization of the surrounding passive structure of the ISS.

Glowbug is a NASA-funded technology demonstrator for sensitive, low-cost gamma-ray transient telescopes developed, built, and operated by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) with support from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, USRA, and NASA MSFC.  It was launched on 2023 March 15 aboard the Department of Defense Space Test Programâs STP-H9 to the ISS.  The detector comprises 12 large-area (15 cm x 15 cm) CsI:Tl panels covering the surface of a half cube, and two hexagonal (5-cm diameter, 10-cm length) CLLB scintillators, giving it a large field of view (instantaneous FoV ~2/3 sky) over a wide energy band of 50 keV to >2 MeV.

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al., 2021, JApA, 42, 73) showed the detection of a faint long-duration GRB 231208A.

The source was detected in the CZT detectors in the 20-200 keV energy range. The light curve peaks at 2023-12-08 02:29:47.75 UTC. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 146 (+47, -32) counts/s above the background in the combined data of three quadrants (out of four), with a total of 231 (+88, -106) counts. The local mean background count rate was 265 (+3, -5) counts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 2.4 (+0.7, -1.2) s. 

CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, URSC, IUCAA, SAC, and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed, and facilitated the project.

we report further analysis of BAT GRB 231205B (trigger #1200812)
(Evans, et al., GCN Circ. 35269). The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 54.151, 27.150 deg which is
RA(J2000) = 03h 36m 36.3s
Dec(J2000) = +27d 09' 00.7""
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 50%.

The mask-weighted light curve shows a strong peak near the time of trigger.
There is also emission prior to the main peak of the lightcurve at ~T-30 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 46.94 +- 7.84 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-29.66 to T+54.16 sec is best fit by a simple
power-law model. The power law index of the time-averaged spectrum is
1.38 +- 0.05. The fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 7.4 +- 0.2 x 10^-06 erg/cm2.
The 1-sec peak photon flux measured from T-5.04 sec in the 15-150 keV band
is 7.1 +- 0.4 ph/cm2/sec. All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence
level.

report on behalf of the GECAM team:

The short burst, GRB 231206A, has been detected by GECAM-B (Liu et al., GCN 35283) and INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS. 
With the ETJASMIN pipeline (Energetic Transients joint analysis system for Multi-INstrument, Xiao et al.,
MNRAS, 514, 2397, 2022) and the data of GECAM-B and INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS, we did a joint location for this burst.

Firstly, we applied the Li-CCF method (Xiao et al., ApJ, 920, 43, 2021) to the high 
temporal resolution (~0.1 ms) light curve of GECAM-B and the low-latency public 50 ms 
light curve of INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS, and derived the triangulation location as the following annuli:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Annulus                 Ra (deg)      Dec (deg)     Radius (deg)      Radius-Error (deg, 3sigma)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then, we combined this triangulation location, the stand-alone location provided by GECAM-B 
(Liu et al., GCN 35283), as well as the Earth occultation of these instruments, 
and derived a refined location, which is much smaller than the stand-alone ones. 

The center (highest probability) of this refined location is:

--------------------------------------
            RA (deg)      Dec (deg)
Center      314.648	  -20.742   
--------------------------------------

The 1-simga region of this refined location is about 295 deg^2. 

The sky map and probability healpix data of this refined location could be found at:

Note that a part of the location region is below the Earth limb of GECAM-B and thus excluded.

This location may be improved.

We identified the compact binary merger candidate S231206cc during real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) at 2023-12-06 23:39:01.498 UTC (GPS time: 1385941159.498). The candidate was found by the CWB [1], GstLAL [2], MBTA [3], PyCBC Live [4], and SPIIR [5] analysis pipelines.

S231206cc is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 1.9e-35 Hz, or about one in 1e27 years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S231206cc

The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH (>99%), NSBH (<1%), BNS (<1%), or Terrestrial (<1%).

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is <1%. [6] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [6] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassgap) is <1%.

Two sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:
 * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 30 seconds after the candidate event time.
 * bayestar.multiorder.fits,2, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time.

The preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,2. For the bayestar.multiorder.fits,2 sky map, the 90% credible region is 445 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 1261 +/- 294 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).

We identified the compact binary merger candidate S231206ca during real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) at 2023-12-06 23:31:34.528 UTC (GPS time: 1385940712.528). The candidate was found by the CWB [1], GstLAL [2], MBTA [3], PyCBC Live [4], and SPIIR [5] analysis pipelines.

S231206ca is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 3.2e-10 Hz, or about one in 1e2 years. The event's properties can be found at this URL:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S231206ca

The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH (>99%), Terrestrial (<1%), BNS (<1%), or NSBH (<1%).

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is <1%. [6] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [6] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassgap) is <1%.

Two sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:
 * bayestar.multiorder.fits,0, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 25 seconds after the candidate event time.
 * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [7], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time.

The preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,1. For the bayestar.multiorder.fits,1 sky map, the 90% credible region is 1986 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 3223 +/- 983 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).

12,GRB231115A: TURBO Pre-Burst Optical Upper Limits,2023-12-06T21:42:43Z,Robert Strausbaugh at Eastern Illinois University <rstrausbaugh@eiu.edu>,email,"R. Strausbaugh (Eastern Illinois University), Daniel Warshofsky (UMN), Pat Kelly (UMN), Mandeep S. S. Gill (UMN), Alexandre Toscano (UMN), Yilin Lu(UMN), Sydney Leggio (UMN), Aksinya Kamenshikova (UMN) report on behalf of a larger collaboration:


We observed M82, including the localization region for the Fermi GRB 231115A (Fermi GBM team, GCN 35035), with the Total-Coverage Ultrafast Response to Binary-Mergers Observatory (TURBO) prototype telescope in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA, as part of a high-cadence ongoing survey for transients in nearby galaxies.  We visited the field 55 times on November 15 UT, with the last visit occurring at 9:06 UT in SDSS r and g bands respectively (corresponding to 6.5 hours before the GRB trigger time).


Each exposure is 30 seconds.  We do not detect a source at the same location as the GROWTH-India counterpart (Kumar et al., GCN 35041) in either band.


The 3-sigma upper limits in the table below are calculated using the Pan-STARRS catalog as reference, and are not corrected for Galactic extinction.


The TURBO prototype in St. Paul consists of two co-mounted 11-inch telescopes each with a 6.6 square degree field of view.


TURBO, which is under construction, will consist of two arrays of 8 pairs of co-mounted 11-inch telescopes at two dark-sky sites: Magdalena Ridge Observatory, New Mexico, USA and Skinakas Observatory, Crete, Greece.

The AGILE satellite detected the GRB 231205B at T0 =  2023-12-05 16:43:59 s (UTC), reported by Swift (GCNs #35269, #35275, #35291) andÂ GECAM-BÂ (GCN #35279).

The burst is clearly visible in the AGILE scientific ratemeters of the MiniCALorimeter (MCAL; 0.4-100 MeV), and AntiCoincidence (AC; 50-200 keV) detectors. The event lasted about 18 s and it released a total number of 11057 counts in the MCAL detector (above a background rate of 539 Hz) and 54466 counts in the AC-Top detector (above a background rate of 2889 Hz).

In the scientific ratemeters of the AC-Top detector is visible a GRB precursor,  centered around -25 s to the Swift T0 and lasting 10 seconds.

Perri (SSDC & INAF-OAR), J.A. Kennea (PSU), A. Tohuvavohu (U. Toronto)
and P.A. Evans report on behalf of the Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 6.5 ks of XRT data for GRB 231205B, from 224 s to 68.4
ks after the  BAT trigger. The data comprise 3 s in Windowed Timing
(WT) mode (taken while Swift was slewing), with the remainder in Photon
Counting (PC) mode. 

The light curve can be modelled with an initial power-law decay with an
index of alpha=0.27 (+0.04, -0.05), followed by a break at T+6137 s to
an alpha of 1.32 (+/-0.08).

A spectrum formed from the PC mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index of 2.06 (+/-0.10). The
best-fitting absorption column is  4.5 (+/-0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 1.5 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion
factor deduced from this spectrum  is 3.8 x 10^-11 (6.2 x 10^-11) erg
cm^-2 count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     4.5 (+/-0.5) x 10^21 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 1.5 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: 9.6 sigma
Photon index:	     2.06 (+/-0.10)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
1.32, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.063 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 2.3 x
10^-12 (3.9 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

We report an analysis of observations of the vicinity of the IC231202A high-energy neutrino event (GCN 35225) with all-sky survey data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT), on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The IceCube event was detected on 2023-12-02 at 17:08:24.09 UT (T0) with J2000 position RA =  139.04 (+1.52, -1.96) deg, Decl. = +0.37 (+1.11, -1.40) deg (90% PSF containment).  According to the fourth Fermi LAT source catalog (4FGL-DR4), there is one 4FGL-DR4 cataloged gamma-ray (>100 MeV; The Fermi-LAT collaboration 2022, ApJS, 260, 53) source, 4FGL J0909.1+0121 (PKS 0906+01), in the 90% IC231202A uncertainty localization region. Based on a preliminary analysis of the LAT data over one month and day timescale prior T0, this object is not significantly detected at gamma rays.

We searched for intermediate (days to years) timescale emission from a new gamma-ray source. Preliminary analysis indicates no significant (> 5 sigma) new excess emission (> 100 MeV) at the IC231202A best-fit position. Assuming a power-law spectrum (photon index = 2.0 fixed) for a point source at the IC231202A best-fit position, the >100 MeV flux upper limit (95% confidence) is <6.0e-10 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for ~15-years (2008-08-04 to 2023-12-02 UTC), and < 4.3e-9 (<6.1 e-8) ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-month (1-day) integration time before T0.

Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this region will continue. For this observation the Fermi-LAT contact person is C. Bartolini (chiara.bartolini at ba.infn.it).

We started observations at 16:45:33 UT on 2023-12-05, 94 s after the BAT trigger. Observations were made in clear conditions. No source consistent with the XRT (J.P. Osborne et al., GCN Circ. 35275) was detected. We report the following results:

The first row in the table corresponds to co-adds of an initial short exposure image sequence of 0.5 s for g' and r' (these sub-second exposures are read-noise suppressed by our EMCCD cameras, with high gain electron multiplication active; other images are taken in conventional CCD operation mode), and 7.5 s for i'. The second row corresponds to co-adds from a continuing series of 3 s exposures for g' and r', and 15 s for i'.  Calibration was done with the 3 bright Pan-STARRS catalog stars on our images.

25 degrees above horizon and weather conditions were poor,
with high altitude clouds.

According to the realtime alert data, the GECAM-B light curve shows roughly two peaks with a total duration of ~40 sec (15-1050 keV). 

The time-averaged spectrum of GECAM-B realtime data from about T0 to T0+4 s could be
adequately fit by a Band function with a fluence about 8.20E-7 erg/cm^2 in 20-1000 keV. 

The GECAM light curve could be found here:

GECAM location is consistent with that of Swift/BAT within the error.

We have performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube consistent with the sky localization of the low-significance gravitational-wave candidate event S231205c in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time (2023-12-05T00:49:30 UTC to 2023-12-05T01:06:10 UTC) [1,2]. 
During this time period IceCube was collecting good quality data. A single hypothesis test 
was conducted,  using a Bayesian approach to quantify the joint GW + neutrino event significance, which assumes a binary merger scenario and accounts for known astrophysical priors, such as GW source distance, in the statistical significance estimation [3].  

One track-like event is found in spatial and temporal coincidence with the gravitational-wave 
Candidate S231205c calculated from the map circulated in the S231205c-2-Preliminary notice. This represents an overall p-value of 0.0083 for the Bayesian search. The p-value 
measures the consistency of the observed track-like events with the known atmospheric backgrounds for this single map (not accounting for statistical trials from multiple GW events). 

Further details are available at https://gcn.nasa.gov/missions/icecube and at https://roc.icecube.wisc.edu/public/LvkNuTrackSearch.

Properties of the coincident events are shown below:

The Glowbug gamma-ray telescope [1,2], operating on the International Space Station, reports the detection of GRB 231204A, which was also detected by Fermi/GBM, AstroSat/CZTI, and CALET (GCN 35258, 35267, 35272).

Using an adaptive window with a resolution of 32-ms, the burst onset is determined to be 2023-12-04 20:00:02.808 with a duration of 11.3 s and a total significance of about 27.2 sigma.  The light curve comprises a dominant triple-peaked structure from T0 to ~T0+6s and a fainter pulse at ~T0+9s.

Using a standard power-law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff [3] to model the emission over this duration results in a photon index dN/dE~E^x of x=0.6 and a cutoff energy (""Epeak"") of 619 keV.  The modeled 10-10000 keV fluence is 1.3e-05 erg/cm^2.

The analysis results presented here are preliminary and use a response function that lacks a detailed characterization of the surrounding passive structure of the ISS.

Glowbug is a NASA-funded technology demonstrator for sensitive, low-cost gamma-ray transient telescopes developed, built, and operated by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) with support from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, USRA, and NASA MSFC.  It was launched on 2023 March 15 aboard the Department of Defense Space Test Programâs STP-H9 to the ISS.  The detector comprises 12 large-area (15 cm x 15 cm) CsI:Tl panels covering the surface of a half cube, and two hexagonal (5-cm diameter, 10-cm length) CLLB scintillators, giving it a large field of view (instantaneous FoV ~2/3 sky) over a wide energy band of 50 keV to >2 MeV.

T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a known recurrent nova with the next, long-anticipated explosion expected in early 2024. The 2024 nova eruption prediction is based on the approximately 80-year recurrence between prior outbursts and the recent detection of the start of a pre-eruption dip (in March/April 2023; ATel #16107), which may indicate a change in the accretion state (e.g., Luna et al. 2020, ApJL, 902, L14). This dip was also observed prior to its last outburst in 1946. Because of its proximity (distance ~0.9 kpc; Schaefer 2022, MNRAS, 517, 6150), T CrB is expected to be detected brightly as a gamma-ray transient with a peak (E >100 MeV) flux of ~(1-2) x 10^-5 photons cm^-2 s^-1 if it is similar to other known recurrent symbiotic novae detected by Fermi-LAT (e.g., V407 Cyg; Ackermann et al. 2014, Sci, 345, 554; RS Oph 2021; Cheung et al. 2022, ApJ, 935, 44).

In consideration of its expected bright outburst in gamma rays, a preliminary Fermi-LAT aperture light curve (daily and weekly bins) is updated daily and publicly available at: https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/source/T_CrB .

At 16:43:59 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and
located GRB 231205B (trigger=1200812).  Swift slewed immediately to the burst. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 54.154, +27.146 which is 
   RA(J2000) = 03h 36m 37s
   Dec(J2000) = +27d 08' 47""
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single peak
structure with a duration of about 40 sec.  However there
may be activity before the start of the immediately-available
data, as the burst occurred during a pre-planned slew.  The peak count
rate was ~6000 counts/sec (15-350 keV), at T-3, before the
nominal trigger time. 

The XRT began observing the field at 16:47:54.0 UT, 234.5 seconds after
the BAT trigger. Using promptly downlinked data we find an uncatalogued
X-ray source located at RA, Dec 54.14912, 27.14099 which is equivalent
to:
   RA(J2000)  = 03h 36m 35.79s
   Dec(J2000) = +27d 08' 27.6""
with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcseconds (radius, 90% containment). This
location is 23 arcseconds from the BAT onboard position, within the BAT
error circle. This position may be improved as more data are received;
the latest position is available at https://www.swift.ac.uk/sper. No

Firstly, we applied the Li-CCF method (Xiao et al., ApJ, 920, 43, 2021) to the realtime high temporal resolution (~1 ms) light curve of GECAM-B and the low-latency public 50 ms light curve of INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS, and derived the triangulation location as the following annuli:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Annulus                 Ra (deg)      Dec (deg)     Radius (deg)      Radius-Error (deg, 3sigma)
GECAM-B + SPI-ACS       209.519       59.889        40.961            1.272
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then, we combined this annulus location, the stand-alone locations provided by GECAM-B (Tan et al., GCN 35266) and Fermi/GBM (Fermi/GBM team, GCN 35263), as well as the Earth occultation of these instruments, and derived a refined location, which is much smaller than stand-alone ones. 

This refined location (~3 sigma region) could be approximately described by a polygon region,
whose center and corners are:

--------------------------------------
            Ra (deg)      Dec (deg)
Center      205.313	  19.155   
Corner1     215.859       19.155
Corner2     209.883       18.724
Corner3     202.148       18.871
Corner4     194.766       20.427
Corner5     205.313       19.524

41,GRB 231204A: AstroSat CZTI detection,2023-12-05T14:16:15Z,Gaurav Waratkar at IIT Bombay <gauravwaratkar@iitb.ac.in>,Web form,"G. Waratkar (IITB), P. K. Navaneeth (IUCAA), A. Vibhute (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IITB), D. Bhattacharya (Ashoka University/IUCAA), A. R. Rao (IUCAA/TIFR), and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al., 2021, JApA, 42, 73) showed the detection of the long-duration GRB 231204A which was also detected by Fermi-GBM (Fermi GBM Team, GCN Circ. 35258).

The source was clearly detected in the CZT detectors in the 20-200 keV energy range. The light curve peaks at 2023-12-04 20:00:04.5 UTC. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 230.7 (+39.0, -34.4) counts/s above the background in the combined data of all quadrants, with a total of 1319 (+234, -237) counts. The local mean background count rate was 347.5 (+2.1, -2.9) counts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 13 (+7, -5) s.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range. The light curve peaks at 2023-12-04 20:00:06.6 UTC. The measured peak count rate is 873.2 (+83.1, -58.1) counts/s above the background in the combined Veto data of all quadrants, with a total of 6070 (+508, -547) counts. The local mean background count rate was 1532.5 (+4.8, -5.7) counts/s. We measure a T90 of 12 (+8, -3) s from the cumulative Veto light curve.

CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, URSC, IUCAA, SAC, and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed, and facilitated the project.

42,GRB 231205A: GECAM-B detection of a short burst,2023-12-05T03:48:51Z,tanwj@ihep.ac.cn,Web form,"GRB 231205A: GECAM-B detection of a short burst

Wenjun Tan, Shaolin Xiong, report on behalf of the GECAM team:

GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by a short burst, GRB 231205A
at 2023-12-05T02:25:11.450 UTC(T0), which was also observed by 
Fermi/GBM (Fermi/GBM team, GCN 35263).

According to the realtime alert data of GECAM-B, this burst consists 
of one bright short pulse followed by weaker emission with a total 
duration (T90) of about ~0.3 sec (30-1020 keV).

Using the automatic on-ground localization pipeline with the realtime alert data, 
GECAM-B localized this burst to the following position (J2000): 
Ra: 202.8 deg 
Dec: 26.8 deg
Err: 6.1 deg (1-sigma, statistical only)
GECAM location is consistent with that of Fermi/GBM within the error.

The time-averaged spectrum of GECAM-B realtime data from about T0-0.05 s to T0 could be
adequately fit by a cut-off power-law with a fluence about 1.10E-6 erg/cm^2 in 20-1000 keV. 

We note that these results are based on realtime alert data and thus very preliminary. 

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor
(GECAM) mission originally consists of two microsatellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B)
launched in Dec. 2020. As the third member of GECAM constellation, 
GECAM-C was launched onboard SATech-01 experimental satellite in July 2022. 
GECAM mission is funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

Swift/BAT was observing 93.6% of the GW localization probability (Bilby.multiorder.fits) at merger time. A fraction 57% of the GW localization posterior is contained inside the BAT coded FoV.

The LVK notice, distributed in near real-time, triggered the Swift Mission Operations Center operated Gamma-ray Urgent Archiver for Novel Opportunities (GUANO; Tohuvavohu et al. 2020, ApJ, 900, 1).

Upon trigger by this notice, GUANO sent a command to the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) to save 200 seconds of BAT event-mode data from [-50,+150] seconds around the time of the burst. All the requested event mode data was delivered to the ground.

Using the NITRATES analysis (DeLaunay + Tohuvavohu 2022, ApJ, 941, 169), we searched for emission on 8 timescales from 0.128s to 16.384s in the interval [-20,+20] seconds around the merger time. We find no evidence for a signal, and derive the following upper limits.

We quote the 5-sigma flux upper limits in the 15-350 keV band, weighted over the GW localization, for four spectral templates (soft, normal, and hard GRB-like templates described in [arXiv:1612.02395], and spectral shape from GRB170817A [arXiv:1710.05446]) and for four time bins.

IceCube has performed a search [1] for additional track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction of IceCube-231202A (https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars/35255) in a time range of 1000 seconds centered on the alert event time (2023-12-02 17:00:04.090 UTC to 2023-12-02 17:16:44.090 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. Excluding the event that prompted the alert, zero track-like events are found within the 90% containment region of IceCube-231202A. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-231202A ranges from 1.4e-01 to 1.5e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 1000 second time window. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2.5 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 3e+02 GeV and 2e+05 GeV. 

A subsequent search was performed including 2 days of data centered on the alert event time (2023-12-01 17:08:24.090 UTC to 2023-12-03 17:08:24.090 UTC). In this case, we report a p-value of 1.00, consistent with no significant excess of track events. The IceCube sensitivity to neutrino point sources with an E^-2.5 spectrum (E^2 dN/dE at 1 TeV) within the locations spanned by the 90% spatial containment region of IceCube-231202A is 1.6e-01 GeV cm^-2 in a 2 day time window.

the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor Team:

""At 07:01:30.77 UT on 03 December 2023, the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)
triggered and located GRB 231203A (trigger 723279695/231203293),
which was also detected by Swift/BAT-GUANO  (DeLaunay et al. 2023, GCN 35257).
The Fermi Final Localization was reported in GCN 35252.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight is 59 degrees.

The GBM light curve consists of multiple peaks with a duration (T90)
of about 37 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum
from T0-1.1 to T0+28.6 s is best fit by
a power law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff.
The power law index is -0.92 +/- 0.05 and the cutoff energy,
parameterized as Epeak, is 687 +/- 114 keV. 

The spectrum is also well fit by a Band function with Epeak = 543 +/- 108,
alpha = -0.86 +/- 0.07, and beta = -2.10 +/- 0.30.

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is
(9.7 +/- 0.4)E-06 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured
starting from T0+0.45 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 4.5 +/- 0.2 ph/s/cm^2.

The spectral analysis results presented above are preliminary;
final results will be published in the GBM GRB Catalog:

Kennea (PSU), Tyler Parsotan (NASA GSFC) report: 

Swift/BAT did not localize GRB 231203A onboard (T0: 2023-12-03T07:01:30.77 UTC, Fermi trig 723279723) 

The Fermi notice, distributed in near real-time, triggered the Swift Mission Operations Center operated Gamma-ray Urgent Archiver for Novel Opportunities (GUANO; Tohuvavohu et al. 2020, ApJ, 900, 1). 

Upon trigger by this notice, GUANO sent a command to the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) to save 200 seconds of BAT event-mode data from [-50,+150] seconds around the time of the burst. All the requested event mode data was delivered to the ground. 

The BAT likelihood search, NITRATES (DeLaunay + Tohuvavohu 2022, ApJ, 941, 169), performed on the temporal window [T0-20 s, T0+20 s], detects the burst with a sqrt(TS) of 13.6 in a 2.048 s analysis time bin, starting at T0. 

NITRATES results are consistent with a burst coming from outside the FOV, with DeltaLLHOut of 2.64.

See Section 9.1 and Figures 10 and 17 in the NITRATES paper for brief descriptions and interpretation of sqrt(TS), DeltaLLHPeak, and DeltaLLHOut. 

GUANO is a fully autonomous, extremely low latency, spacecraft commanding pipeline designed for targeted recovery of BAT event mode data around the times of compelling astrophysical events to enable more sensitive GRB searches.

AGILE detection: Panebianco et al., GCN Circ. 35244)
triggered Konus-Wind at T0=69016.319 s UT (19:10:16.319).

The burst light curve shows a bright, multi-peaked pulse
featuring a very strong hard-to-soft spectral evolution.
The pulse starts at ~T0-0.2 and has a total duration of ~9.6 s.
The emission is seen up to ~15 MeV.

The Konus-Wind light curve of this GRB is available at
http://www.ioffe.ru/LEA/GRBs/GRB231129_T69016/

As observed by Konus-Wind, the burst
had a fluence of 8.60(-0.23,+0.24)x10^-5 erg/cm2,
and a 64-ms peak flux, measured from T0+0.106s,
of 4.16(-0.52,+0.54)x10^-5 erg/cm2/s
(both in the 20 keV - 10 MeV energy range).

The time-averaged spectrum of the burst
(measured from T0 to T0+12.800 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 20 MeV range
by the GRB (Band) model with the following parameters:
the low-energy photon index alpha = -0.17(-0.06,+0.06),
the high energy photon index beta = -2.95(-0.12,+0.10),
the peak energy Ep = 202(-6,+6) keV
(chi2 = 151/97 dof).

The spectrum near the maximum count rate
(measured from T0 to T0+0.256 s)
is best fit in the 20 keV - 20 MeV range
by a power law with exponential cutoff model:
dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep)
with alpha = -0.20(-0.14,+0.15)
and Ep = 782(-52,+55) keV (chi2 = 69/51 dof).
Fitting by a GRB (Band) model yields the same alpha and Ep,
and an upper limit on the high energy photon index: beta < -3.3
(chi2 = 69/50 dof).

All the quoted errors are at the 90% confidence level.
All the quoted values are preliminary.

On 2023-12-02 at 17:08:24.09 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Bronze alert stream. The average astrophysical neutrino purity
for Bronze alerts is 30%. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 4.4035 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection.

After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/138632_31747601.amon), more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:

Dec: +0.37 (+1.11, -1.40 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000

Deployment of updated software delayed the availability of these results, we apologize for the delay.  We encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.

One gamma-ray source listed in the 4FGL-DR4 Fermi-LAT catalog is inside the 90% uncertainty region. The source is 4FGL J0909.1+0121, located 2.0 deg away from the best-fit position. The source is also listed in the Fermi 3FHL catalog as 3FHL J0909.1+0121.

Swift-XRT has conducted further observations of the field of the
Fermi/GBM-detected burst GRB 231129C. The observations now extend from
T0+34.8 ks to T0+172.6 ks. The source previously reported, ""Source 2"",
is believed to be the afterglow.  The position of this source is RA,
Dec=11.1769, -81.9936 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 00:44:42.45
Dec(J2000): -81:59:37.0

with an uncertainty of 9.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).  This
position is 22.4 arcmin from the Fermi/GBM position.  We cannot
determine at the present time whether the source is fading.

We obtained 2x300s unfiltered exposures of the 90% error region of the MAXI/GSC X-ray transient (Kawakubo et al. GCN 35223) with the 0.8-m PROMPT-7 telescope. Exposures began at 2023-11-30 00:53 UT. Relative to images of the field 24-hours later, we do not detect any new sources within the MAXI/GSC error region with an upper limit of 21.9 calibrated to g-band reference stars from the ATLAS reference catalog (Tonry 2018). 

We also observed the position of the MASTER OT detection (Antipov et al, GCN 35240) in a series of unfiltered 6x200s exposures beginning at 2023-12-01 01:56 UT, and do not detect the transient in the stacked image to an upper limit of 22.5. The field also includes the 90%  error circle for the Swift XRT candidate at RA 00:44:42.45 Dec -81:59:37.0, and we detect no transient sources to an upper limit of 22.5. We note that the error circle closely aligns with a faint (m_G=19.96) red star (Gaia 4630203649665987840).

The Fermi notice, distributed in near real-time, triggered the Swift Mission Operations Center operated Gamma-ray Urgent Archiver for Novel Opportunities (GUANO; Tohuvavohu et al. 2020, ApJ, 900, 1). 

Upon trigger by this notice, GUANO sent a command to the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) to save 90 seconds of BAT event-mode data from [-50,+150] seconds around the time of the burst. All the requested event mode data was delivered to the ground. 

The BAT likelihood search, NITRATES (DeLaunay + Tohuvavohu 2022, ApJ, 941, 169), performed on the temporal window [T0-20 s, T0+20 s], detects the burst with a sqrt(TS) of 92.6 in a 4.096 s analysis time bin, starting at T0 + 3.072 s. 

NITRATES results are consistent with a burst coming from outside the FOV, with DeltaLLHOut of -477.

See Section 9.1 and Figures 10 and 17 in the NITRATES paper for brief descriptions and interpretation of sqrt(TS), DeltaLLHPeak, and DeltaLLHOut. 

A preliminary localization of this GRB was performed, finding a best fit position of 
RA, Dec = 301.3, -80.4 deg
With a roughly circular 90% error radius of 11.1 deg

Calibration of systematics for localizations outside the coded field of view is not yet complete.

GUANO is a fully autonomous, extremely low latency, spacecraft commanding pipeline designed for targeted recovery of BAT event mode data around the times of compelling astrophysical events to enable more sensitive GRB searches.

Using the data set from T-61 to T+243 sec from the recent telemetry downlink,
we report further analysis of BAT GRB 231129A (trigger #1199764)
(Gropp et al., GCN Circ. 35208).  The BAT ground-calculated position is
RA, Dec = 317.541, 41.530 deg which is
   RA(J2000)  =  21h 10m 09.8s
   Dec(J2000) = +41d 31' 48.3""
with an uncertainty of 1.0 arcmin, (radius, sys+stat, 90% containment).
The partial coding was 46%.

The BAT  light curve shows a complex structure with a duration of ~ 130 sec.
T90 (15-350 keV) is 105.46 +- 1.83 sec (estimated error including systematics).

The time-averaged spectrum from T-1.75 to T+118.97 sec is best fit by a power law
with an exponential cutoff.  This fit gives a photon index 1.35 +- 0.17,
and Epeak of 83.7 +- 14.6 keV (chi squared 51.44 for 56 d.o.f.).  For this
model the total fluence in the 15-150 keV band is 1.3 +- 0.0 x 10^-05 erg/cm2
and the 1-sec peak flux measured from T+88.71 sec in the 15-150 keV band is
4.8 +- 0.3 ph/cm2/sec.  A fit to a simple power law gives a photon index
of 1.78 +- 0.04 (chi squared 70.95 for 57 d.o.f.).  All the quoted errors
are at the 90% confidence level.

The best LAT on-ground location is found to be R.A., Dec. = 9.1, -81.9 (degrees, J2000) with an error radius of 0.7 deg (90% containment, statistical error only). 
This was 49 deg from the LAT boresight at the time of the GBM trigger:
T0 = 19:10:18.11 UT.
The data from the Fermi-LAT show a significant increase in the event rate after the GBM trigger that is spatially correlated with the GBM emission with high significance. The photon flux above 100 MeV in the time interval 0-200 s after the GBM trigger is (3.2 +/- 0.9)E-4 ph/cm2/s.
The estimated photon index above 100 MeV is -2.4 +/- 0.4. The highest-energy photon is a 0.7 GeV event which is observed 4 seconds after the GBM trigger.

The Glowbug gamma-ray telescope [1,2], operating on the International Space Station, reports the detection of GRB 231129C, which was also detected by Fermi/GBM, MAXI/GSC, CALET, AstroSat/CZTI, and GECAM-B (GCN 35217, 35221, 35222, 35223, 35227, 35228, 35230, 35231).

Using an adaptive window with a resolution of 32-ms, the burst onset is determined to be 2023-11-29 19:10:16.184 with a duration of 8.19 s and a total significance of about 116 sigma.  The light curve comprises an initial triple-peaked structure from T0 to ~T0+4s, followed by fading emission.

Using a standard power-law function with an exponential high-energy cutoff [3] to model the emission over this duration results in a photon index dN/dE~E^x of x=1.4 and a cutoff energy (""Epeak"") of 349 keV.  The modeled 10-10000 keV fluence is 1.5e-05 erg/cm^2.

The analysis results presented here are preliminary and use a response function that lacks a detailed characterization of the surrounding passive structure of the ISS.

Glowbug is a NASA-funded technology demonstrator for sensitive, low-cost gamma-ray transient telescopes developed, built, and operated by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) with support from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, USRA, and NASA MSFC.  It was launched on 2023 March 15 aboard the Department of Defense Space Test Programâs STP-H9 to the ISS.  The detector comprises 12 large-area (15 cm x 15 cm) CsI:Tl panels covering the surface of a half cube, and two hexagonal (5-cm diameter, 10-cm length) CLLB scintillators, giving it a large field of view (instantaneous FoV ~2/3 sky) over a wide energy band of 50 keV to >2 MeV.

78,GRB 231129C: AstroSat CZTI detection,2023-11-30T09:47:31Z,Gaurav Waratkar at IIT Bombay <gauravwaratkar@iitb.ac.in>,Web form,"G. Waratkar (IITB), P. K. Navaneeth (IUCAA), A. Vibhute (IUCAA), V. Bhalerao (IITB), D. Bhattacharya (Ashoka University/IUCAA), A. R. Rao (IUCAA/TIFR), and S. Vadawale (PRL) report on behalf of the AstroSat CZTI collaboration:

Analysis of AstroSat CZTI data with the CIFT framework (Sharma et al., 2021, JApA, 42, 73) showed the detection of an extremely bright long-duration GRB 231129C which was also detected by Fermi-GBM (Fermi GBM team, GCN Circ. 35217), MAXI/GSC (Kawakubo et al., GCN Circ. 35223), and CALET (Shimizu et al., GCN Circ. 35228).

The source was clearly detected in the CZT detectors in the 20-200 keV energy range. Based on the orientation of the CZTI, the burst saturated two quadrants (A, B out of four). We report two versions of our analysis of CZT data: one from two unsaturated quadrants (C, D), and the other for all four quadrants by including unsaturated data segments from A, B. 

For the two unsaturated quadrants C and D, the light curve peaks at 2023-11-29 19:10:18 UTC. The measured peak count rate associated with the burst is 1189 (+237, -8) counts/s above the background in the combined CD data, with a total of 3838 (+150, -144) counts. The local mean background count rate was 155.1 (+3.7, -5.9) counts/s. Using cumulative rates, we measure a T90 of 5.1 (+0.2, -0.2) s in these two quadrants. 

Using unsaturated data segments from all four quadrants, we report that burst duration was 6.7 (+0.2, -0.2) s. We also report a minimum peak count rate of 4164.2 (+328.9, -329.3) counts/s at a local mean background count rate of 334.8 (+6.7, -7.4) count/s, with a total of at least 8061 (+195, -236) counts. In the preliminary analysis, we find 1362 Compton events associated with this event in all four quadrants.

It was also clearly detected in the CsI anticoincidence (Veto) detector in the 100-500 keV energy range. The light curve peaks at 2023-11-29 19:10:18.69 UTC. The measured peak count rate is 4408 (+125, -126) counts/s above the background in the combined Veto data of all quadrants, with a total of 18860 (+406, - 410) counts. The local mean background count rate was 1511.3 (+6.5, -7.7) counts/s. We measure a T90 of 5.5 (+0.2, -0.2) s from the cumulative Veto light curve.

CZTI is built by a TIFR-led consortium of institutes across India, including VSSC, URSC, IUCAA, SAC, and PRL. The Indian Space Research Organisation funded, managed, and facilitated the project.

The angle from the Fermi LAT boresight at the GBM trigger time is 50 degrees.

The GBM light curve shows a very bright, single pulse starting from about T0+0 s to T0+15 s. The calculated duration (T90) is about 6 s (50-300 keV). The time-averaged spectrum from T0+0 s to T0+7 s can be fit by a Band function with Epeak = 215 +/- 2 keV, alpha = -0.11 +/- 0.01, and beta = -2.79 +/- 0.03. 

The event fluence (10-1000 keV) in this time interval is (8.41 +/- 0.04)E-05 erg/cm^2. The 1-sec peak photon flux measured starting from T0+1.8 s in the 10-1000 keV band is 102 +/- 1 ph/s/cm^2.

Swift-XRT team:

We have analysed 7.0 ks of XRT data for GRB 231129A, from 115 s to 43.8
ks after the  BAT trigger. The data comprise 174 s in Windowed Timing
(WT) mode with the remainder in Photon Counting (PC) mode. The refined
XRT position is RA, Dec = 317.5437, +41.5206 which is equivalent to:

RA (J2000): 21 10 10.49
Dec(J2000): +41 31 14.2

with an uncertainty of 3.5 arcsec (radius, 90% confidence).

The light curve can be modelled with a series of power-law decays. The
initial decay index is alpha=4.86 (+/-0.21). At T+165 s  the decay
steepens to an alpha of 6.44 (+0.28, -0.24) before breaking again at
T+308 s to a final decay with index alpha=0.83 (+0.05, -0.06).

A spectrum formed from the WT mode data can be fitted with an absorbed
power-law with a photon spectral index	of 1.83 (+/-0.07). The
best-fitting absorption column is  1.09 (+/-0.08) x 10^22 cm^-2, in
excess of the Galactic value of 5.9 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al.
2013). The PC mode spectrum has a photon index of 2.18 (+0.31, -0.29)
and a best-fitting absorption column of 1.6 (+/-0.4) x 10^22 cm^-2. The
counts to observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux conversion factor
deduced from this spectrum  is 5.0 x 10^-11 (1.2 x 10^-10) erg cm^-2
count^-1. 

A summary of the PC-mode spectrum is thus:
Total column:	     1.6 (+/-0.4) x 10^22 cm^-2
Galactic foreground: 5.9 x 10^21 cm^-2
Excess significance: 4.5 sigma
Photon index:	     2.18 (+0.31, -0.29)

If the light curve continues to decay with a power-law decay index of
0.83, the count rate at T+24 hours will be 0.014 count s^-1,
corresponding to an observed (unabsorbed) 0.3-10 keV flux of 7.2 x
10^-13 (1.8 x 10^-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1.

P. A. Evans (U. Leicester) reports on behalf of the Swift team:

Swift has initiated a series of observations, tiled on the sky, of the
MAXI GRB 231129B. Automated analysis of the XRT data will
be presented online at http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_products/TILED_GRB00116

Any uncatalogued X-ray sources detected in this analysis will be
reported on this website and via GCN COUNTERPART notices. The probability of finding
serendipitous sources, unrelated to the MAXI event is high: any X-ray source
considered to be a probable afterglow candidate will be reported via a GCN Circular
after manual consideration.

Details of the XRT automated analysis methods are detailed in Evans et
al. (2007, A&A, 469, 379; 2009, MNRAS, 397, 1177 and 2014, ApJS, 210, 8).

report on behalf of the MAXI team:

The MAXI/GSC nova alert system triggered a bright uncatalogued X-ray transient source at 14:03:05 UT on 29 November 2023.
Assuming that the source flux was constant over the transit,
we obtain the source position at
(R.A., Dec) = (285.662 deg, 40.278 deg) = (19 02 38, +40 16 40) (J2000)
with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region
with long and short radii of 0.39 deg and 0.26 deg, respectively.
The roll angle of long axis from the north direction is 75.0 deg counterclockwise.
Without assumptions on the source constancy, we obtain a rectangular error
box for the transient source with the following corners:
(283.889, 39.749) deg = (18 55 33, +39 44 56) (J2000)
(284.232, 39.302) deg = (18 56 55, +39 18 07) (J2000)
(286.730, 40.399) deg = (19 06 55, +40 23 56) (J2000)
(286.398, 40.853) deg = (19 05 35, +40 51 10) (J2000)
There is an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius).

The X-ray flux averaged over the scan was 141 +- 32 mCrab
(4.0-10.0keV, 1 sigma error).
There was no significant excess flux in the previous transit at 12:30 UT
with an upper limit of 20 mCrab.

Buson (Univ. of Wuerzburg), S. Garrappa (Weizmann Institute of Science), C. Bartolini (INFN Bari) and J. Sinapius (DESY) on behalf of the Fermi-LAT collaboration:

We report an analysis of observations of the vicinity of the IC231125A high-energy neutrino event (GCN 35194) with all-sky survey data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT), on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The IceCube event was detected on 2023-11-25 at 22:34:56.64 UT (T0) with J2000 position RA = 177.53 (+3.99, -4.03) deg, Decl. = +53.62 (+1.57, -1.64) deg (90% PSF containment). There are two gamma-ray (>100 MeV; 4FGL-DR4, The Fermi-LAT collaboration 2023, arXiv:2307.12546) sources located within the 90% IC231125A localization region. These are:

4FGL J1215.0+5351, associated with the BL LAC GB6 J1215+5349;
4FGL J1208.9+5441, associated with the FSRQ TXS 1206+549

We searched for intermediate (days to years) timescale emission from a new gamma-ray transient source. Preliminary analysis indicates no significant (> 5 sigma) new excess emission (> 100 MeV) at the IC231125A best-fit position. Assuming a power-law spectrum (photon index = 2.0 fixed) for a point source at the IC231125A best-fit position, the >100 MeV flux upper limit (95% confidence) is < 1.77e-10 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for ~15-years (2008-08-04 to 2023-11-26 UTC), and < 8.10e-9 (<8.91e-8) ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-month (1-day) integration time before T0.

Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this region will continue. For these observations the Fermi-LAT contact person is L. Pfeiffer (leonard.pfeiffer at stud-mail.uni-wuerzburg.de). 

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden.

We identified the compact binary merger candidate S231129ac during real-time processing of data from LIGO Hanford Observatory (H1) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (L1) at 2023-11-29 08:17:45.643 UTC (GPS time: 1385281083.643). The candidate was found by the CWB [1], GstLAL [2], and SPIIR [3] analysis pipelines.

S231129ac is an event of interest because its false alarm rate, as estimated by the online analysis, is 1.8e-08 Hz, or about one in 1 year, 9 months. The event's properties can be found at this URL:

https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S231129ac

The classification of the GW signal, in order of descending probability, is BBH (99%), Terrestrial (1%), NSBH (<1%), or BNS (<1%).

There was a high rate of noise transients (glitches) in the LIGO Hanford detector which may affect the parameters or the significance of the candidate.

Assuming the candidate is astrophysical in origin, the probability that the lighter compact object is consistent with a neutron star mass (HasNS) is <1%. [4] Using the masses and spins inferred from the signal, the probability of matter outside the final compact object (HasRemnant) is <1%. [4] Both HasNS and HasRemnant consider the support of several neutron star equations of state. The probability that either of the binary components lies between 3 and 5 solar masses (HasMassgap) is <1%.

Two sky maps are available at this time and can be retrieved from the GraceDB event page:
 * bayestar.multiorder.fits,1, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [5], distributed via GCN notice about a minute after the candidate event time.
 * bayestar.multiorder.fits,2, an initial localization generated by BAYESTAR [5], distributed via GCN notice about 5 minutes after the candidate event time.

The preferred sky map at this time is bayestar.multiorder.fits,2. For the bayestar.multiorder.fits,2 sky map, the 90% credible region is 3175 deg2. Marginalized over the whole sky, the a posteriori luminosity distance estimate is 5958 +/- 1935 Mpc (a posteriori mean +/- standard deviation).

GECAM-C was triggered in-flight by a long burst, GRB 231129A, at 2023-11-29T05:06:01.850 UTC (T0), which was also observed by Swift/BAT (GCN #35208) and INTEGRAL (GCN #35209). 

According to the realtime alert data, the GECAM-C light curve shows roughly two peaks with a total duration of ~80 sec (15-1050 keV). 

The time-averaged spectrum of GECAM-C realtime data from about T0 to T0+4 s could be
adequately fit by a cut-off power-law with a fluence about 1.84E-6 erg/cm^2 in 20-1000 keV. 

GECAM location is consistent with that of Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL within the error.
We note that these results are based on realtime alert data and thus very preliminary. Refined analysis will be reported later.

Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor(GECAM) mission originally consists of two microsatellites (GECAM-A and GECAM-B) launched in Dec. 2020. As the third member of GECAM constellation, GECAM-C was launched onboard SATech-01 experimental satellite in July 2022. GECAM mission is funded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
